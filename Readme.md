## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-fit-analyzer.git
cd job-fit-analyzer
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the environment:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS & Linus:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Your API Key
1. The application loads the Gemini API key from an environment variable for security.
2. The application loads the Gemini API key from an environment variable for security.
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
3. You can get your API key from Google AI Studio. 

## Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can run the application.
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the Flask application from the root directory:
```bash
python app.py
```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
4. Upload a resume, provide a job description (via upload or text), and click "Analyze Fit"!

## How It Works
The application follows a simple but powerful workflow:

1. **Frontend**: The user uploads a resume and job description via the web interface.
2. **Flask Backend**: The server receives the files/text.
3. **Text Extraction**: PyMuPDF and python-docx parse the uploaded files to extract raw text.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: The extracted text is formatted into a detailed prompt for the LLM.
5. **Gemini API Call**: The prompt is sent to the Gemini API.
6. **JSON Response**: Gemini returns a structured JSON object containing the full analysis.
7. **Display Results**: The backend sends the parsed JSON to the frontend, where it is displayed to the user in a clean format.
